# 380CT-CW2
This GitHub repository has the code and various testing documentation for the second 380CT coursework in regards to the subset-sum problem.
The individuals who have worked on this code are Nicholas Beard, Christoph Hall, and Carl Fitzgerald.

All code included has been discussed thoroughly between the group, with no members not contributing.
A lot of the code has been done with the group together in person on one machine, which can explain the lack of various commits.
